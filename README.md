On to preparing for the examination. Let me break it down for you. There are a total of 3 different sections in the exam.

1. Quantitative Reasoning (20 questions, 30 minutes)
2. Logical Reasoning (30 questions, 30 minutes)
3. Visual Thinking (30 questions, 30 minutes)

## Quantitative Reasoning
This is basic math, middle school and high school math that you can do really well in if you were in middle or high school. Right now, you've probably forgotten everything. There're questions such as: If Mary could paint a wall in 2 hours, and Joe could paint the same wall in 5h ours, how long would both of them take to paint the wall together? Of course, the style of questions would be different from other tests like the GMAT so having the book (which is a direct representation of questions that would appear in GSAT) would be of great help.

## Logical Reasoning
This area is the hardest and takes a lot of quick thinking as well as understanding the question. An example would be 6 people: A, B, C, D, E, and F. They're all employees in a company, where A and B are managers, C and D are secretaries and E and F are clerks. Then you are given a set of rules such as A does not arrive at work earlier than E, or D and F come into work at the same time. Then, based on the question, you will either have to pick the option that would likely NOT happen, or the one that is true. Again, learning it from the book would help a lot. 

## Visual Thinking
This one has many variations across different examinations. However, the ones that you would need to practice are very unique to Samsung's exam. There are different sections on comparing shapes, finding the dice (it's a die that has different faces, not one of numbers) that is different, visualizing the back of origami folded in various directions. 

The good thing about this exam is that there is no need for writing of any sort. Everything is multiple choice so at the end of the day, you know one of them is your answer. Be warned, though, as wrong answers deduct points off your total score. This is to discourage people from making a guess and answering every question in the paper with guesses. You will need to make sure that the question you answer is correct with at least 95% confidence. 

That's the most information I can give you from my experience taking the exam. Good luck to those who are taking it. If you have any question, feel free to contact me through any of my social links on the right!
